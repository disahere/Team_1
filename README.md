Name of game: Exile

Members: Denys, Illya

Position: Denys- Coding, Illya - Design

Concept: You are stranded in a world full of different creatures and biomes. You start with nothing but advance and get weapons, tools, armor and additional equipment which gives you buffs like: faster regeneration, bigger damage, faster movement speed, etc. You'll have to fight different bosses to advance further into the game and to finish it. Bosses will spawn once you enter a specific structure for them and be there for 1 minute. If you make houses with appropriate size, bed, table, chair and lighting then NPCs will come to your world and sell you things or do other stuff

Unity version: 6000.0.25f1
