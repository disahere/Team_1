Concept: On the dark side of Mexico, people are not treated as a species, but rather as a tool. You're a failed truck driver and you've been fired from your job. You decided to flee your home and go to a small town near the coast La Costa. Here you will get your equipment and your grandpa Luis Caraballo will help you to get started. At first, you will use a truck to drive your captured people to buyers and eventually build an empire.
